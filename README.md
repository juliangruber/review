# review

_Get screenshots of all your running sites in different resolutions!_

Updating large and possibly responsively designed sites can be a hassle. You never know whether your change breakes
anything on the other end of your sitemap, or in a certain resolution, except if have a look at every individual
page...in every resolution you care about.

The idea of `review` is not to test everything (and visual testing is hard) but rather use the human mind's excellent
ability to quickly scan information and filter out what you need, i.e. what is broken.

website, check out [review-host](https://github.com/juliangruber/review-host).

## API

### review()

Returns an http / express request handler.

### review#title(title)

Display `title` in the review. Defaults to `Review`.

### review#sites(sites | fn)

Either pass an object with titles as keys and urls as values, or a `Function` that fetches the sites to be displayed. This way, on every page load that list is refreshed and you can e.g. display all sites present in your sitemap.

```js
review.sites(function (cb) {
  request('http://my.si/temap', function (err, res) {
    if (err) return cb(err)
    cb(null, format(res))
  })
})
```

See [example/sites.js](https://github.com/juliangruber/review/blob/master/example/sites.js)

### review#resolutions(["WxH", "WxH", ...])

Configure the resolutions to use for screenshots. Defaults to `["1200x800"]`

### review#wait(x)

PhantomJS will wait for `x` milliseconds after loading the page before it takes the screenshot, so you can make sure your page is completely loaded. Defaults to `0`.

### review#cache({ dir : 'directory', expires : 60 })

Cache rendered snapshots for `expires` seconds in `dir`.

### review#cut(bool)

If `bool` is `true` then screenshots will be cut to the exact dimensions that you specified. Without this pages can be longer than your specified height.

### review#cookie({'name':'Valid-Cookie-Name', 'value':'Valid-Cookie-Value', 'domain':'localhost', 'path':'/foo', 'httponly':true, 'secure':false)

Configure the cookie that has to be passed, if your site needs it.

### review#listen(port)

Start the review server on port `port`.

## Installation

```bash
$ brew install phantomjs
